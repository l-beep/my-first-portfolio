        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Iam Lovine Oduor an eighteen year old student at Moringa School pursuing a software development course.I'm  a girl from a humble background where we only depend on God to provide as my parents struggle somuch to woirk in order toprovide for our needs.I completed my Primary school Education in the year 2015 from a neighbouring school by the name Sunrays School and joined High School in the year 2016 in a girl's day school called Kariobangi North Girls Secondary School where i completed my Education in the year 2019. Coding is a passion of mine that i developed back at High School where a team from Andela used to teach us coding basics every saturday.I love the technological error that is dominating the present age  and i would like to be  among the developers that will change the world of tomorrow using technology.I believe that through coding i can be able to solve the real problems faced by the real people in the real world.Iam a relentless person that would stop at nothing to realize her goals and for me i believe that <strong>Succes is a battle in the mind that only the relentless people can achieve.</strong></p>
